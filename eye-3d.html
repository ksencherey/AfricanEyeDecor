            <h1>The Process</h1>
            With decades of experience, the Eye 3D team are able to effectively and efficiently manage each phase of your project. We work with a variety of contractors; all with a proven history, utilising the best local tradesmen in their fields.
            <p><b style="color: yellow;">Plot Search</b></p>
            Whilst the majority of our clients already own the land or property that they wish to develop, some require our assistance in sourcing a suitable property or plot for development. We liaise with our network of contacts to find opportunities that meet your requirements and have a realistic potential to obtain planning permission for your desired home.
            <p><b style="color: yellow;">Architecture and Design</b></p>
            First, it’s important to start planning your requirements. How many bedroom suites, en-suites, balconies or walk-in-wardrobes? Homes could include a wet room, steam room, sauna, hair salon, gym, pool, cinema, games room, shark tank; or practically anything else you can think of. The boundaries of design and functionality can be pushed to whatever limits you require.
            Taking your requirements on board, our talented team of designers will work to produce the initial concepts for you to critique. After necessary amendments and modifications are made, we’ll work to create the full drawings and elevations necessary to obtain planning permission. The Eye 3D team will manage the entire planning process for you, from submission through to approval.
